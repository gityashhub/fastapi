Add a new Data Balancer section immediately after the Hypothesis Testing section in the platform workflow.

Core Functionality

Allow users to select feature columns and target columns for applying balancing techniques.

After selecting columns, display all balancing methods from the PDF:

Oversampling Techniques

Random Oversampling

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

Undersampling Techniques

Random Undersampling

Tomek Links

NearMiss-1

NearMiss-2

NearMiss-3

Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN)

Condensed Nearest Neighbors (CNN)

One-Sided Selection (OSS)

Cluster Centroids

Neighborhood Cleaning Rule (NCR)

Hybrid Techniques

SMOTE + Tomek Links

SMOTE + ENN

Advanced Techniques

GAN-based Oversampling

Variational Autoencoder Oversampling

Cost-Sensitive Learning

On clicking Apply, show detailed before vs. after class distribution of the selected columns.

Allow users to download only the balanced columns, but show this message before download:

“Balanced data will have a different number of rows than your cleaned dataset.
Use balanced columns directly for model training.”

Validation & Restrictions

Do NOT allow users to use this feature if the data is uncleaned.
If missing values, invalid datatypes, encoding issues, duplicates, or other uncleaned conditions exist, block the process and throw an appropriate error.

Edge Case Handling

The system must handle all edge cases with clear, friendly error messages, including:

Unsupported or incompatible column types

Class ratio too small for selected technique

Target column is not categorical

Selected target contains only one class

Dataset too small for technique

Invalid column selection

Issues during balancing or transformations

Download generation errors

Flow & Compatibility

Users must still be able to request subsets of the dataset for ML modeling within this section.

Do not modify or interrupt any existing files or sections in the workflow.
Only insert and integrate this new Data Balancer module into the current flow.

Implement the module exactly as described above.
