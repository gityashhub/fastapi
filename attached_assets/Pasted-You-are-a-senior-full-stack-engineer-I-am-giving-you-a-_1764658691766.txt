You are a senior full-stack engineer. I am giving you a complex Streamlit application. 
Your job is to fully convert this Streamlit app into a **React + FastAPI** web application.

### ❗ REQUIREMENTS
1. **Preserve 100% of Streamlit functionality**:
   - File upload (CSV, XLSX, XLS)
   - Data preview (tables, metrics, column statistics)
   - Auto column type detection
   - Column type editing UI
   - Column-wise analysis using ColumnAnalyzer()
   - Progress bars for long-running operations
   - Session handling (session_state logic must be replaced with proper React state or backend session management)
   - Export/Import configuration
   - Alerts, success messages, warnings
   - Sidebar navigation / multi-page structure
   - Dataset persistence for analysis workflows
   - Cleaning history, undo/redo logic (convert to backend state or DB if needed)

2. **Backend must be FastAPI**
   - Do NOT rewrite logic; reuse the Python functions exactly. 
   - Implement session state using Python dictionaries or a session manager.

3. **Frontend must be React (Vite or CRA)**
   - Create pages matching the Streamlit sections:
       - Upload & Configuration
       - Dataset Overview
       - Column Type Editor
       - Column Analysis
       - Visualization
       - Cleaning Wizard
       - AI Assistant
       - Reports
   - Sidebar navigation identical to Streamlit sidebar.
   - Use React components for:
       - File uploader
       - Table viewer (Material UI DataGrid or React Table)
       - Progress bars
       - Sliders
       - Dropdowns
       - Accordions / Expanders
       - Metrics cards
   - API integration using Axios.
   - Global state via Context API or Redux.



5. **Session State Replication**
   - Replace st.session_state with:
       ✔ FastAPI server-side session object or
       ✔ In-memory cache (per user) or
       ✔ Redis (if needed)
   - Ensure dataset, column_types, column_analysis, cleaning_history persist across API calls.

6. **UI Behavior**
   - Every st.button, st.slider, st.selectbox must become a corresponding React UI element.
   - Every st.dataframe must become a React DataGrid.
   - Every st.metric must become a React metric/stat card.
   - Every st.expander must become a React accordion.

7. **Do NOT simplify anything.**
   - Recreate full feature parity.
   - Preserve dynamic logic, loops, analysis, and async behavior.
