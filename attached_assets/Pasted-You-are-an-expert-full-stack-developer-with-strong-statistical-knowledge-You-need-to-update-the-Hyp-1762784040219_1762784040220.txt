You are an expert full-stack developer with strong statistical knowledge. You need to update the Hypothesis Testing page in an existing data cleaning web application.

Current Functionality

User selects dataset

User selects columns

User selects a statistical test

Application returns test results

New Required Functionality

We are adding an AI-assisted test recommendation workflow.

Workflow Changes

User writes a plain language prompt describing their hypothesis (e.g., "I want to compare average income between male and female respondents").

The integrated AI assistant (Groq API) analyzes the prompt and returns:

Recommended statistical tests

Whether test is parametric or non-parametric

Short, beginner-friendly explanation (1–3 sentences max).

After AI suggestion, the UI must show:

Dropdown for Parametric or Non-parametric

Test list based on the document below
(Include every test below, categorized properly)

Include These Tests Exactly
PARAMETRIC TESTS

Means: One-sample t-test, Independent t-test, Paired t-test, One-Way ANOVA, Two-Way ANOVA

Variances: F-test, Bartlett’s Test, Levene’s Test

Proportions: One-sample Z-test, Two-proportion Z-test, Chi-Square Test for Homogeneity

Correlation: Pearson Correlation Test, Partial Correlation

Goodness-of-Fit / Normality: Chi-Square GOF, Shapiro–Wilk, Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Anderson–Darling

NON-PARAMETRIC TESTS

Medians / ranks: Sign Test, Mann–Whitney U, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank, Kruskal-Wallis

Categorical: Chi-Square Independence, Fisher’s Exact, Cochran-Armitage Trend, McNemar

Correlation: Spearman, Kendall’s Tau

GOF: KS Two-Sample, Anderson–Darling, Cramér–von Mises

SPECIALIZED (optional advanced dropdown)

Box’s M Test, MANOVA, Log-Rank Test, Jonckheere–Terpstra, Runs Test

App Behavior Requirements

If selected data is not valid for a test (e.g., non-numeric where numeric is required), show a clear friendly message, not an error trace.

AI suggestions must be simple and educational (not technical jargon).

Final statistical result output format remains the same, only improve UI styling.

Test with small datasets and ensure:

No infinite loading

No UI freezing

Proper error handling

Output Expected

Generate:

Updated frontend UI code

Backend handler logic for:

AI recommendation call

Test classifications

Validation checks before running any test

Clean and maintainable code architecture

Clear comments explaining functionality

Use modern UI components (e.g., Tailwind/Material UI depending on framework).
